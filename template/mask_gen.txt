You are an expert in design, specializing in integrating text with images, particularly when the text follows irregular baselines in artworks, badges, or logos. Based on the description of the image provided, where words in "" are part of the image:

1. Design a layout for the text that follows an irregular baseline.
2. With the layout picture in mind, place the letters on the designed layout.
3. Group adjacent letters that share a similar straight baseline in the layout.
4. For each group, use precise geometric imagination to provide the Oriented Bounding Box (OBB, (cx,cy,h,w,\theta)) with angles (The angle describes how much baseline rotated clockwise, when the text is upsidedown is 180), using the top-left of the canvas as (0,0) and the bottom-right as (1,1).
5. The generated layout should follow the JSON style, where each line starts with the grouped texts and is followed by its OBB with angles. Formally, each line should be like 
json {"Texts":grouped text, "OBB": [cx,cy,h,w,angle]}. 

Examples:
Description:  Description:  A 45 degree leaning sign with words "Deep learning" written on it. 
### Step 1: Design the Layout
- The baseline of the text will follow the angle of the sign, which leans 45 degrees. This means the text will slant to the right with a consistent baseline inclined at 45 degrees from the horizontal.
- The words "Deep learning" will follow this 45-degree inclined baseline.
- For simplicity, I will assume that the words are laid out with relatively uniform letter spacing and alignment along this angled baseline.
### Step 2: Place the Letters on the Designed Layout
- We'll divide the letters into two distinct groups based on the words "Deep" and "learning".
- Since we have two words, I'll place "Deep" at the top and "learning" below it, each following the same inclined baseline.
### Step 3: Group Adjacent Letters that Share a Similar Straight Baseline
- **Group 1:** "Deep" — This group will consist of the first word.
- **Group 2:** "learning" — This group will consist of the second word.
### Step 4: Geometric Imagination and Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)
We now need to calculate the OBBs (Oriented Bounding Boxes) for each group of letters. Since the sign is leaning at a 45-degree angle, the baselines for both words will have the same angular inclination.
- **cx, cy** represent the center coordinates of the bounding box.
- **h** and **w** represent the height and width of the box.
- **θ** is the angle of rotation of the baseline (in degrees), where 0 degrees represents the baseline being horizontal and positive values represent clockwise rotation.
Assume the canvas is normalized with (0,0) as the top-left corner and (1,1) as the bottom-right.
### Step 5: JSON Representation
```json
[
  {
    "Texts": "Deep",
    "OBB": [0.2, 0.2, 0.05, 0.25, 45]
  },
  {
    "Texts": "learning",
    "OBB": [0.3, 0.35, 0.05, 0.5, 45]
  }
]
```
